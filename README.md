The Robodox 599B code library is designed with teaching in mind. There are many examples of functions and logic pulled straight from code from an award-winning VEX robotics team. If you plan on using the library's functions for yourself, I highly recommend you go through and change out the names of all of the motors, sensors, and other variables to match your code. Otherwise, please use this library as a reference sheet to make your code and your robot better!
